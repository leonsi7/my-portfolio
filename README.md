# Porfolio of LÃ©on S.

This repo contains some relevant project I did in the last years. This is a sample of projects I've done entirely on my own or as part of a team (team projects are marked at the beginning of the file). Some of these projects were done as part of my studies, while others were the result of my own desire and curiosity.
Other projects are available on github :

- [Ticket to ride: Europe analysis project](https://github.com/leonsi7/ticket-to-ride-europe)

- [Maze game & solver using Dijskra method](https://github.com/leonsi7/maze-solver-game)

- [Continuous random variable generator](https://github.com/leonsi7/continuous-random-variable-generator)

Enjoy your reading !
